* Replicating Bags of Ints Problem

## Replicating Bags of Ints
The game "West of Loathing" has a certain puzzle in one of its maps (Soupstock Lode) where you have to tighten screws on an elevator to reach a target pressure in order to operate the elveator. In the game, there are three screws and every turn on the screw updates the total pressure by a certain amount every time. However, each screw cannot be turned more than eight times. Thus, the player has to find the correct combination of turns on each of the three screws, up until eight times per screw, to reach the target pressure. 

After a few minutes of trying out different numbers, I finally paused the game and decided to write a program to help progress onwards in this game without a brute force method. Is this a bit extra for a $10 steam game? Perhaps. Was it fun? Indeed. There are more details about the program inside of the .cpp file. I renamed this problem to "Replicating Bag of Ints" as it seemed more generic than "West of Loathing's Elevator Problem."
